* TODO
** it still sometines leaves a trailing comma fix this
** I belive this could be done with just one regexp 
   Maybe this would be better because it would be more efficent but this function will not really be used much very large lists of names.

   Using just one regexp may result in ti being more compleax for little run speed benfit.
